3.	Create model servings based on the respective models
4.	Utilize model toolkit to evaluate model performance and generate reports.
5.	Create research reports for future research decisions.

Task:
-----
1.	Discuss with the team to break down research tasks.
2.	Maintain current dataset using dataset toolkit.
3.	Train YOLO/darknet models.
4.	Studying other training environments such as mmdetection, detectron2, de-tr, U-Net, darknet.
5.	Create model serving implementations from each respective model.
6.	Generate reports.
